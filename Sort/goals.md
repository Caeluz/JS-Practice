# Goals

1. **Visualization Customization:** Allow users to customize the visualization, such as choosing different colors for bars representing data, adjusting animation speeds, or selecting different visualization styles.

2. **Algorithm Comparison:** Implement a feature to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms side by side. This could include displaying sorting time, number of comparisons, and swaps for each algorithm.

3. **Additional Sorting Algorithms:** Besides Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort, consider implementing other sorting algorithms such as Selection Sort, Heap Sort, or Radix Sort.

4. **Random Data Generation:** Provide options to generate random data arrays with varying sizes and distributions, allowing users to test sorting algorithms under different scenarios.

5. **User Input:** Allow users to input their own data arrays to be sorted, enabling them to experiment with specific datasets.

6. **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Implement a feature to step through the sorting process one iteration at a time, allowing users to understand how each algorithm works.

7. **Data Visualization:** Visualize additional statistics about the sorting process, such as comparisons, swaps, or memory usage, using charts or graphs.

8. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as invalid user input or runtime errors.

9. **Persistent Settings:** Allow users to save their preferred settings and configurations across sessions, using local storage or browser cookies.

10. **Localization:** Support multiple languages to make the visualizer accessible to users worldwide.

11. **Testing and Optimization:** Perform thorough testing to ensure the visualizer is robust and optimized for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
